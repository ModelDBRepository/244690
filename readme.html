<p>This is the readme for the code associated with the paper:
</p><p>Smolen P, Baxter DA, Byrne JH (2018) Paradoxical LTP maintenance with
inhibition of protein synthesis and the proteasome suggests a novel
protein synthesis requirement for early LTP reversal. J Theor Biol
<br/><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.08.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.08.026</a>
</p><p>This java script was contributed by P Smolen.
</p><p>The java program runs and outputs the simulation depicted in Figure
3A, panels 1-3, of Smolen et al. 2018.  To compile and run this,
</p><ol>
  <li>Unzip the file,
  </li><li>Install a standard Java compiler.  I used Java Development Kit from Oracle.
  </li><li>Should compile and run with no errors.</li></ol>
<p>For example on a MacBook Pro with Oracle Java 8:
</p><p>Type the following on the command line after cd'ing to the new folder
created from unzipping the file:
</p><p>javac Fig3A13.java<br/>
java Fig3A13
</p><p>Then the following new data files should appear in your folder
</p><p>bas.txt ep2.txt np.txt ups.txt ed.txt lac.txt pp.txt stab.txt wsyn.txt
ep1.txt lp.txt psi.txt stim.txt
</p><p>If you run the matlab program by typing "grapher" on the matlab command prompt you should see this graph similar to figures Fig 1 A1, A2, A3 in the paper:
